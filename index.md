Hello, I'm Max Beutel, I'm Software Developer in Singapore.
====================

My name is Max Beutel, I'm 30 years old, from Bavaria in Germany. I lived 10 years in Munich before I moved one year ago to Singapore.

When I'm not developing web applications for a living, I like to improve my [emacs configuration](https://github.com/maxbeutel/my-emacs-config), program [algorithms in C](https://github.com/maxbeutel/learn-c-the-hard-way/blob/master/exercise-32/c-skeleton/src/liblcthw/hashmap.c) or learn [functional programming in Rust](https://github.com/maxbeutel/rust-example-ascii). Sometimes I also write [articles](/articles). When I'm not in front of a computer I like to do any of the sports I'm fond of.

You can contact me on [GitHub](http://github.com/maxbeutel/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-beutel-379101112) and [XING](https://www.xing.com/profile/Max_Beutel2).
