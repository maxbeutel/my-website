<h1>Rust - Uniqify vector by function</h1>

<p>Recently I was looking for a function that can deduplicate a vector in Rust via some custom "deduplication" callback function. There is <code>Vec::dedup</code> but if I need some special logic for how to uniqify the vector, there was no way for it.</p>

<p>I was a bit surprised that there is nothing like that in the Rust standard library, but soon there will - there is a Pull Request for adding <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/36743"><code>Vec::dedup_by</code> and <code>Vec::dedup_by_key</code></a> functionality and it was merged not too long ago. Given the release frequency of Rust, I'm pretty sure it will land very soon in stable, in the meantime I backported the functions:</p>
